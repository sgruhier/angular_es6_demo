Angular 1.3 / ES6 demo
================

I wanted to learn more about how to use ES6 with angular JS. For two main reasons:

* Learn more about ES6, because I'm pretty sure 2015 will be ES6 year
* Learn more about how to use ES6 with angular 1.3. This is a great step to prepare working with angular 2.0

I had to display a globe with threejs in an application I'm working on, I decided to make a simple directive to display the globe.
I also needed to display arcs between different locations. For that, I did a controller that loads a JSON file and shares data with the directive.

I think code is easy to read. If you have any questions, ping me on twitter https://twitter.com/sgruhier

Run
===

Start a local server from the root folder with python (python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000) or serve (npm install serve)

Todo
====

Try to make it working with angular 2.0

Thanks
